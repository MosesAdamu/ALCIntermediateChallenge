#ALCIntermediateChallenge

Assessment test for Andela's Android Learning Community Intermediate track.~~

This challenge is to give the ALC Team an idea of my programming experience on the Android platform.~~~

This is an Android app that retrieves a list of Java Developers in Lagos using the Github API. 
The App has the following functionalities:

    -It displays the list of developers on a list. Each item on the list has the user's:
        -Profile image
        -GitHub username and
        -GitHub profile URL 
        
    -Clicking each item on the list shows their profile details.
    
    -The profile screen contains:
        -Username
        -Profile photo
        -Github profile URL and
        -A button to share their profile.
        
Cheers,
